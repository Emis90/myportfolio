      <p>I am a New York based software developer. I have been learning how to code and solve algorithms on my own and decided to persue this carreer. I attended the Grace Hopper bootcamp at Fullsdtack Academy of code, where I got my most recent education.  I am experienced working with Java Script, NERD Stack (Node.js, Express, React, Databases). I love coming up with solutions and learning new ways to approach a problem, this is why I decided to do software development.
